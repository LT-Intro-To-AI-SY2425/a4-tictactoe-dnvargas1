# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was doing the has_won function, inputting all of the correct combinations was a bit of a hassle and also making sure that the player had one of the correct combinations as well. It was tricky, and required a lot of thinking to accomplish.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Adding a computer player to the game would require there to be automated inputs into the board every turn. This could done by iterating through a randomizer for inputting X's or O's into the board possibly. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
In order to get the computer player to play the best move every time, you could either iterate through an if statement that would place an X or O next the user players input, or else it places its input in a random position instead. Additionall, you could input a specific set of moves that the computer could go through that would simulate the best set of moves a player can make, and implenet a series of if statements in case a specific spot is taken.
